# Cortisol

Let's discover **Cortisol in less than 5 minutes**.

## What is Cortisol?

An open-source and easy to use command-line tool that provides cost estimation and forecasting for main observability tools like [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/), [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) and [GCP Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging), helping users plan and optimize their log costs pre-production. ðŸ’°ðŸ“‰.

It's heavily based on [Locust](https://locust.io/), and that means that you define the behaviour of your users in a regular Python script.

### Name & Background

Picture this: the world of observability is brimming with fantastic tools like Grafana, Datadog, and New Relic. But here's the catch â€“ costs can sneak up on you, catching you off guard or, worse, too late. And don't get us started on those log costs; they can go from "too little" to "what?!" in no time, even for the simplest web services. We wanted a tool that's right there in the thick of your software development workflow, because programming should always be a joyful ride.

In Cortisol, you define the behaviour of your users using Python code, much like you would in load testing scenarios. Various load testing scenarios result in logs of different sizes, leading to differing costs. Having this information beforehand can assist you in more effective budgeting and, potentially, in eliminating unnecessary log statements from your code.

Cortisol takes its name from the steroid hormone that helps our bodies respond to stress by increasing alertness, boosting energy, and regulating metabolism. It also plays a role in controlling blood sugar levels, reducing inflammation, and supporting the immune system.
